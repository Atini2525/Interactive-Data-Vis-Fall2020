# Tutorial 0

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development. 

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](./GIT_SETUP.md)
- to build a [local development environment](./BASIC_SERVER.md)

### Deploy

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the link to your deployed example as a comment to the appropriate post on the Commons. (Note: your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2020/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the start of the next class.

## Week 1 Assignment:

- [ ] Replicate the process on your own computer. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory (`tutorial0_serve/` [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
- [ ] Update the table's conditional formatting to highlight something meaningful for your new dataset. This may include changing the logic for the cell's [class](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_classed), adding another [attribute](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_attr), or directly augmenting the cell's [style](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_style).

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Add logic to update the appearance of an _entire row_ (not just a single cell).
- [ ] Add a summary row for totals/averages of your data.
