# Installations

The first step is to install all the appropriate software to get our environment together. Please install the following on the computer you intend to complete all the tutorials from. 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) version control software. You will also need an account on [Github.com](https://github.com/).
    - NOTE: If you are using a PC, an application called "git bash" will be part of the default git install. You should use this application every time we reference "terminal", rather than the "command prompt". Mac users, you will be using the default terminal already installed on your machine.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - javascript development software. You can check if the install was succesful by running `node -v` in your git bash (PC) or terminal (Mac). It should return your version number. 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - free code editor and IDE (our recommendation)
