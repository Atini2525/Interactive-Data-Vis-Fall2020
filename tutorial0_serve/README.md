# Tutorial 0

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development. 

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](./GIT_SETUP.md)
- to build a [local development environment](./BASIC_SERVER.md)

### Deploy

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data7320062268.commons.gc.cuny.edu):
1. a link to your commited code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2020/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2020/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the start of the next class. All tutorials are due on 10/28. 

## Week 1 Assignment:

- [ ] Replicate the process on your own computer. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory (`tutorial0_serve/` [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
- [ ] Update the language in the console log. Pick anything at all -- but it should be different than 'Hello World!' to show that your javascrip code changes are connected to your site.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Use the javascript file to explore javascript syntax. Console log any more interesting findings, such as the result of a function.
